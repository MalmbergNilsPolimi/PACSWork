Good use of GitHub.
README should contain istruction for compilation and running.
You could avoid uploading the whole libraries and tell the user to modify a line in the Makefile to link them locally.

Avoid std::pow and rely on other implementations, as seen in the Labs.
Avoid calling the header file with the definition of the Parameters struct main.hpp.

You could improve the implementation of the vector operations relying on methods of the std library and replace the for loops.

You could have used a function template for the choice of the method for the computation of the learning rate.
